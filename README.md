# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-with-Python

The "Medical Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning with Python" project on GitHub aims to predict medical insurance costs using machine learning techniques in Python. The project focuses on building a regression model to estimate the insurance charges based on various features such as age, sex, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of children, smoker status, and region.

The project typically follows these steps:

Data Exploration: The dataset is examined to gain insights into the available features, their distributions, and potential relationships with the target variable (insurance charges). Descriptive statistics and visualizations may be used to analyze the data.

Data Preprocessing: This step involves handling missing values, dealing with categorical variables (such as one-hot encoding), scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Selection and Training: Several regression models, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, or Gradient Boosting Regression, are considered. The training data is used to fit the chosen model, and model performance is evaluated using suitable metrics.
